    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Linked seperate JS file to index, set up loop in main JS file to check for specific properties within the array stored, simplified code to allow for calculations to occur alongside the loop. Wrote psuedocode to explain how the process works</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>There was a lot to take in, but even when interupted was not difficult to follow.</p>
