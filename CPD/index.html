    <h4>Arrays, Objects And Loops Practical</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>

    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Linked seperate JS file to index, set up loop in main JS file to check for specific properties within the array stored, simplified code to allow for calculations to occur alongside the loop. Wrote psuedocode to explain how the process works</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>There was a lot to take in, but even when interupted was not difficult to follow.</p>

    <h3>29/06/2021</h3>
    <h4>An Introduction to the DOM (Document Object Model)</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>A review of objects, and how they relate to events and methods, and how they change the object's properties. Covered objects the browser is made of, and how the 'document' object represents an HTML page. The browser takes the HTML code and makes a DOM of it, which is then stored in memory. It then does the same for CSS. JavaScript uses both of these and so an individual model is not needed for that code. Introduced to JS code that accesses the DOM, allowing us to select individual or groups of elements, and creates arrays so we can read the properties of each object. Learned about code that can interact with objects by changing their properties, including modifying CSS, and changing source links on images.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Created a new JS file for the Final Project HTML file, created arrays for the images, buttons and text, created code to interact with each element, on both the visual and console level.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>Much more information to take in than I expected, will need to review to better understand how everything works and goes together. Struggled to see the relevance of having an individual CSS file if all the changes could be made in JavaScript.</p>
  </article>

    <h3>30/06/2021</h3>
    <h4>The DOM Practical</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Controlling the visibility of Divs and images using JavaScript, using functions, if statements, counters and forEach statements, as well as how to change CSS using similar statements</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Created additional statements in the JS file within the Final Project folder. Used the statments to filter images on the web page as per the buttons when they are clicked</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>Despite interuption on a number of occasions, the task did not seem particularly difficult to understand or implement.</p>
